- [Z-index issue with safari](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40895387/z-index-not-working-on-safari-fine-on-firefox-and-chrome) - This challenge can be completed using CSS only, like I did. For mobile-menu you need to add z-index which will work fine on browsers like Firefox and Chrome but not with Safari. Solution to the problem.
